<B><BIG>XFBB.SH (/usr/local/fbb)</BIG></B>


This is the very first file that LinFBB will use. You will find it in 
/usr/local/fbb-directory. (or in that directory you chosen when you installed
LinFBB).  You don't really need to do any changes in this file, unless you did
some changes during the installation-process.  If you did, you must change 
the pathnames in LinFBB.SH exactly the same as you did during the installation.
This is very important ! So look for the lines that I have marked with 
an     &lt;---      below.

This file is used to start both the deamon version and X-Windows version of 
LinFBB, to start the deamon version you should type: ./xfbb.sh -d &amp;
in X-Windows xterm you should start LinFBB with: ./xfbb.sh

You must go to the LinFBB root directory before executing this shell
script.
