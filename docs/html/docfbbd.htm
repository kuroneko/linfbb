<PRE>The syntax of the various FBBDOS commands is very close to that of 
MsDos(R).

Several specific commands have been added: PUT and GET for ASCII file
transfers. XPUT, YPUT and XGET, YGET for binary file transfers.

EDIT command for ASCII files editing.

When entering FBBDOS, the prompt shows the virtual directory in which the
user is located. There is no physical drive concept (A, C, etc...), the user
is situated in a directory defined in the <A HREF="fmtinit.htm">INIT.SRV</A> file; this directory
becomes the root of the available directory tree. Should the user be a SYSOP,
and if he successfully validated his privileges using the SYS command, the
root of FBBDOS will be the root of the current drive.

A file created by a user belongs to this user.
Only the owner of the file, or a SYSOP granted writing privileges (SYS
command) are permitted to delete or modify this file.
