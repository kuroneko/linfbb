(Appendix 1)
<PRE>
 The FBBDOS offers a small line editor allowing the process of ASCII 
files.  It can help the remote SysOp to maintain the system files of 
the software.

 The commands are straightforward, and for better efficiency, they can
be chained on a single line.

Here are the available commands:


<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">?</FONT> : Shows all commands that can be used in the editor.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">A</FONT> : Adds a line after the current line.  The text for the new line
    shall follow the letter A.  If more commands are to follow after
    the text, the text must be ended with a "/" before next command.  If 
    the sign "/" itself is to used in the text, a "\" must be written 
    just before the "/".  If again the "\" is to be used inside the text
    as a valid character, it must be written twice ("\\").  
    The pointer will be at the start of the new line.
      
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">B</FONT> : Go to start of file.
   
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">E</FONT> : Go to end of file.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">F</FONT> : Search for the first occurrence of a character (or string of 
    characters) in the file.  The search starts at the current line.
    The string of characters must be ended with a "/" if more commands
    are chained (se the paragraph on the A-command).
       
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">I</FONT> : Insert a line before the current line.  Read about ending with a
    "/" in the paragraph on the A-command.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">K</FONT> : Delete the number of lines that are stated just before the letter K.
    Example:  3K
    If no number is used, then 1 line is deleted.
       
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">L</FONT> : Move a number of lines from the current line.  The number can be 
    negative to move towards the start of the file.
    Examples:  5L   -10L
       
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">N</FONT> : Toggle line-numbering on/off.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">P</FONT> : Show a number of lines from the current line.  Example 8P.  This
    will show 8 lines, starting with the current line.
       
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">R</FONT> : Search and replace.  Search for a string of characters and replace it
    with a new one.  Example:  RALL/ALLE  will replace all ALL with ALLE
    from the current line to the end of the file.  
       
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">S</FONT> : Save file.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Q</FONT> : Exit the editor without saving the file.


Examples::


    "EDIT&gt;B5L10P" sets pointer at start of file.  Move 5 lines down, and
                  show 10 lines from there.
                  
    "EDIT&gt;B4L6K-2L1OP" sets the pointer to the start of file.  Move down
                  4 lines.  Delete 6 lines.  Move back 2 lines, and show
                  10 lines.
                     
    "EDIT&gt;BFBonjour/K-2L5P" sets the pointer to the start of file,
                  searches for "Bonjour", deletes the line containing
                  "Bonjour",  moves back 2 lines and shows 5 lines.
                     
    "EDIT&gt;BFBonjour/IC'est une nouvelle ligne avec un \/ dedans/-1L3P"
                  sets the pointer to start of file.   Searches for
                  "Bonjour", inserts the new line.  The new line also
                  contains the character "/".  Goes back 1 line and
                  shows 3 lines.
                     
    "EDIT&gt;SQ"     save file and quit the editor.
