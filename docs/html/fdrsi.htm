(Appendix 5)
<P>
<PRE> If you plan to use DRSI-card with this software, you must make some changes.
Before you start FBB, you must load the DRSI-driver that comes with the DRSI-
card. This must be TNCTSR-R or TNCTSR-L with a version-number higher or equal
to 2.1.

 The first DRSI-card (MultCh 0 and 1) must be at address 300.
 The second DRSI-card (MultCh 2 and 3) must be at address 310.
 The third DRSI-card (MultCh 4 and 5) must be at address 308.
 The fourth DRSI-card (MultCh 6 and 7) must be at address 318.

 Before installing cards in the PC, use the program CHKADDR to verify that
the addresses corresponding to the cards have a value of FF. If there is a
problem, check your configuration to find what peripheral is already using
this address. Install just one card at the time, and verify each cards
presence with CHKADDR.

 When all cards are ok, configure the driver by means of the TAILORnn program
(depending of the version). TNCTSR-S will be ok if you use only a few
channels, while TNCTSR-L should be used for big configurations, up to 32
channels.

 One problem: What DRSI calls DRSI-PORT, is what we call MultCh in FBB ! What
DRSI calls PORT, is what FBB calls port or TNC ! We always use FBB-names
here...

 Each DRSI-card works like 2 radio-ports. The first DRSI-card is always
MultCh 0 and 1, and the forth card is MultCh 6 and 7. If one radio-port is
used on HF, that port must be the second port on the card.

 All the DRSI-cards together, work like only one COM. And this COM-port does
not need to exist in the PC. You may call that port COM 7 or COM 8 and keep
free the already existing COMS.

 Baud-rate does not matter, but should be set to a standard value, to avoid
error-messages.

 Here is an example of PORT.SYS with 2 DRSI-cards (4 radios) :

 #
 #Ports TNCs
 1      4
 #

 #
 #Com Interface Address (Hex) Baud
 7    4         0            4800
 #

 #
 #TNC NbCh Com MultCh Pacl Maxfr NbFwd MxBloc M/P-Fwd Mode Freq
 1    8    7   0      230  4     1     10     30/60   UDYW 433.650
 2    1    7   1      80   2     1     5      12/30   GDW  15/20m
 3    8    7   2      230  4     1     10     36/60   UDYW 433.650
 4    8    7   3      230  4     1     5      10/30   GDW  145.300
 #

 If you are using DRSI-card, you also must change the INITTNC1.SYS. You will
need only ONE file for all the ports.

 Example of INITTNC1.SYS that initializes 4 ports:
 MUIS
 U0
 p0 1 64 10 4 4 10 100 18000 30 2 0
 p1 1 64 10 4 1 16 100 18000 30 1 0
 p2 1 64 10 4 4 10 100 18000 30 2 0
 p3 1 64 10 4 4 10 100 18000 30 2 0




 The same goes for MAINT1.SYS, only 1 file is needed for all 4 ports, like
this:


 Y 1
 U 1 BBS ($c) was shut down for service $d $T.


 In FORWARD.SYS there is no changes. Use standard syntax.

 Well, I think that should be all (for DRSI). Oh, bye the way: DRSI cannot
limit the number of connections per radio-port. But in FBB we still can have
NbCh set to for example 1. When a station then connects to the BBS on that
radio-port, and there already is one user connected there, the BBS will send
a message to him: "Sorry, no more channels available" and disconnect him.
