 This file is in SYSTEM directory.

 The first line in this file is the generic password. That is, this password
will be used for all sysops that do NOT have a special password of his own.
Be adviced to change this to your own, secret password !

 The next line is a special password for one special sysop. In this case
LA6CU. The two first numbers correspond to the same "security-numbers" in
<A HREF="fmtinit.htm">INIT.SRV</A> (check this). So in this case of LA6CU, I will have the security-
number 69 before a successful SYS-command, and 1023 after. In the next line
the numbers for LA6IM is 123 and 1023.

 Each line in PASSWD.SYS can have a maximum of 255 characters.  For the first
tests with the BBS-program, you will only need the first line. Write whatever
you like in it, and have a copy of it an paper. And let nobody else see that
paper (hi).

To get priviliges as a remote sysop, you must first have been declared as a
sysop with the EU-command.  Set flag S for Sysop.
Next you must send the command SYS to the BBS.  The BBS will answer like:
LA1B-5&gt;  12 53 45 28 92  [0852415395]
You will have to respond by 5 characters, the 5 corresponding to the 5
numbers you have received from the BBS.  The extra numbers in brackets, the
[0852415395], is for an automatic MD2 password decoding system, which has
been implemented in TPK and some other terminal-programs (I believe..).
You may ignore the numbers in the brackets.
