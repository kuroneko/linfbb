  Acknowledgments
</H1>
<P>
I would like to particularly thank Patrick F5GHV who was my first "official"
beta-tester.
<P>
I also must thank Per LA6CU, who helps me from many years to set up this
software, debugging and documentation, as well as Claude F1CDC, the"dumb
individual", who, with his advices and criticism (often vitriolic!), has
given his support in this task.
<P>
I would like to thank, as well, all the beta-test team and all the programmers
for the development of applications and complementary tools for this software.
Such a support made me free of these tasks, very often ingrate.
<P>
I thank again all the SYSOPS and users who are confident in the product,
and cooperate, thanks to their comments and suggestions, in improving this
BBS software package.
<P>
I would like, at the end, to thank WA8DED for the excellent piece of software,
the Host-Mode for the TNC, and also NORD&gt;&lt;LINK for the additions made
to it.
