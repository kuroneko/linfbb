EPURMESS is a tool which allows for modification of messages: status,
<PRE>removal, or archiving. This tool is called every night by the BBS in order to
maintain the message list as a function of the time.

 The EPURMESS configuration is made by the text file EPURMESS.INI. The
parameters which are contained are given as a suggestion, and can be edited
later if needed, to suit the targeted archiving and the mass of messages and
bulletins received.

 EPURMESS searches the current directory for its EPURMESS.INI initialization
file. In that file, it will find out all the parameters for processing, as
well as the file name for the report EPURMESS.RES (this file name can be
changed in the EPURMESS.INI file).

 At the beginning of the process, EPURMESS first copies <A HREF="fmtdirme.htm">DIRMES.SYS</A> into
DIRMES.OLD to keep an archive trace of the previous file, then creates
DIRMES.NEW, in which the processing will take place. At the end of the
process,  DIRMES.NEW  will  be  copied  into  DIRMES.SYS.  A  report of the
processing will be written in the EPURMESS.RES file.

 If the last update of the <A HREF="fmtdirme.htm">DIRMES.SYS</A> file has been carried out more than 24
hours ago, EPURMESS will not make its process, in order to avoid any loss of
data due to a possible clock error in the system. It will report the error in
the EPURMESS.RES file. In such a case, after the reason of the error has been
detected, it will be necessary to suppress the EPURMESS.RES report file, in
order to re-enable the processing.

 The ARCHIVE line has two digits, the first one applies to private messages
and the second to bulletins. The '1' digit validate the archiving while the
'0' will suppress the messages once and for all.

 It is possible to specify origins, destinations or routing for which the
obsolete time (X status) are different from the default values. These
particular cases are specified at the end of the file with the form of
supplementary lines. Each line specifies a particular case.

 The line should begin with the character which specifies the field to be
tested, then the content of the field and then the number of days before the
status X is given.

 Ex :
 &gt; ALL 1

 The messages for ALL will be valid only one day.

 Example of EPURMESS.INI file:


# File for deciding messages' lifetime..
#
# Directory for messages
\FBB\MAIL\
#
# Directory for binary-messages
\FBB\BINMAIL\
#
# Directory for "killed" messages
\fbb\OLDMAIL\
#
# The file DIRMES.SYS (database-file)
\fbb\system\DIRMES.SYS
#
# Old database-file (backup)
\fbb\system\DIRMES.OLD
#
# New database-file (after EPURMESS (cleanup))
\fbb\system\DIRMES.NEW
#
# Result of cleanup is put into this file:
\FBB\EPURMESS.RES
