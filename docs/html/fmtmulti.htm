<PRE>MULTI.EXE, server for FBB-BBS.
(By LA6CU, Per)

This server is used to send personal copies of special messages.  The 
original is addressed to a special "call", and then there is automatically
made personal copies to everyone that shall have one.

MULTI may work in 2 ways.  You may use one of them, or both.  I use both at
the same time.

New in version 3.00:
The server may use different languages.  There is a new file MULTI.TXT (reside
in SYSTEM-directory) that holds all languages.  There is one "module" for
each language.  See the text in MULTI.TXT for more info.


1:  WITH DAT-FILES:
-------------------

Installation:

MULTI.EXE is put in the same directory as SERV.EXE.   MULTI will read from
<A HREF="fmtinit.htm">INIT.SRV</A>...

In INIT.SRV, MULTI is included together with <A HREF="fmtreqfi.htm">REQFIL</A>, <A HREF="fmtreqdi.htm">REQDIR</A> etc.  Example:
#
------
#
REQFIL  REQFIL
REQDIR  REQDIR
CLUB    MULTI
TEST    MULTI
#

In this example all messages sent to
SP CLUB
will be copied to all callsigns in the file CLUB.DAT, while messages sent to
SP TEST
will be copied to all callsigns in the file TEST.DAT.

CLUB.DAT and TEST.DAT (in this example) must stay in the FBB-directory.
You must make one such .DAT-file for every to-field you define in INIT.SRV.

The .DAT-files must consist of callsigns (@BBS and H-addresses allowed) for 
all those that shall have a copy.

There are 4 different copy-types.
A (action)      :  This is the callsign that will receive the message, or
                   perform the action described in the message.
C (copy)        :  This callsign receives a copy of the message.
I (information) :  This callsign receives a copy for information.
H (hidden)      :  This callsign receives a copy, but his callsign will not
                   appear in the footnotes of the message, telling who has
                   received a copy.
                   
There may be more than one callsign on each line (starting with A, I, C or H)
separated by a comma.  There may be maximum 100 callsigns altogether.  
Comment-lines are extras, they MUST start with a #

From version 3.00 there will also be a separate line with a letter 
corresponding to the language the server will use.  What letter corresponds
to what language, is explained in MULTI.TXT.

Example of CLUB.DAT:

E                           &lt;-----  Use ENGLISH language for CLUB-server
A LA6CU, LA1B, LA2D         &lt;-----  Copies to the people doing the job
A LA6GDA                    &lt;-----    "     "   "   "    "     "     "
                                    May be several lines if there is not 
                                    enough room in one line. 
I LA5RBA                    &lt;-----  LA5RBA is informed on the matter
C LA6IM @ LA6IM             &lt;-----  LA6IM receives a copy for updating his
                                    node-lists
H LA2GIA                    &lt;-----  LA2GIA receives a copy, but will not appear
                                    in the list of callsigns at the end of
                                    each message.

Beware:  The .DAT-files shall consist of callsigns and comments, nothing 
         else !  No /EX, no * and no *** end of file.

MULTI will NOT send a copy back to the originator, even if he also is in
the .DAT-file.  This to avoid "looping" of messages.
MULTI will send an acknowledge-message back to the originator, telling 
him that the copying was successful, and show him a list of all callsigns
that will receive such a copy.

R:lines on incoming messages are removed, until there has arrived 2 lines
without R:  After that. R:lines are accepted again.  This is done to make it
possible also to forward messages back the same route, and at the same time
make it possible to include R:lines in the message itself.

R:lines are NOT checked to prevent forward to BBSs that are already in
these R:lines, because a message to a MULTI-server only will be processed
at the end-BBS anyway.

MULTI needs very little memory (I have not checked how much..), but I have
been told that it needs less than 35k.  MULTI does not write to screen.

MULTI.EXE must be in the same directory as SERV.EXE.
From version 3.00 the .DAT-files must be in the SYSTEM-directory.
MULTI.TXT must also be in SYSTEM-directory.

MULTI makes a temporary file MULTI.TMP on disk, and delete it afterwards.
Everything else is done in memory, and the result is placed in MAIL.IN, as
all servers do.


2:  WITH ALL CALLSIGNS DIRECTLY IN THE ORIGINAL-MESSAGE.
--------------------------------------------------------

MULTI still works exactly as before, with the same installation.  But after
a request from F6ABJ and F6FBB I have made a modification so that users
themselves can decide what callsigns will receive a copy.  This is done
by including the callsigns in the message itself.

In INIT.SRV, MULTI is still included like before (see further up).  But
in addition, you now must have 1 extra line, like this:

#
------
#
REQFIL  REQFIL
REQDIR  REQDIR
CLUB    MULTI
TEST    MULTI
MULTI   MULTI               &lt;----  This line is new.
#

From version 3.00 SP MULTI uses the default language (see MULTI.TXT).
Other languages may be configured.  For example you may have:
MULTI   MULTI   (for default language)
MULTIE  MULTI   (for english language)
MULTIF  MULTI   (for french language)
MULTIH  MULTI   (for netherlands language)
MULTIN  MULTI   (for norwegian language)
So, you may send the same message SP MULTI, SP MULTIE, SP MULTIF, SP MULTIH,
SP MULTIN etc.  The first 5 letters must always be MULTI, when used without
DAT-file.  Default language will typically be english (SP MULTI), but the
users will have the possibility to use others, as configured.

Users will now be able to send messages to MULTI, like this:
SP MULTI     The program will now collect the info on who will receive a 
copy, from the message itself, and not from a seperat .DAT-file like 
SP CLUB or SP TEST still will do.

There are 4 different copy-types.
A (action)      :  This is the callsign that will receive the message, or
                   perform the action described in the message.
C (copy)        :  This callsign receives a copy of the message.
I (information) :  This callsign receives a copy for information.
H (hidden)      :  This callsign receives a copy, but his callsign will not
                   appear in the footnotes of the message, telling who has
                   received a copy.
(In addition one may use CC: instead of only C for Copy.  Special request..)

There may be more than one callsign on each line (starting with A, I, C or H)
separated by a comma.  There may be maximum 100 callsigns altogether.  
Comment-lines are extras, they MUST start with a #

Example:
SP MULTI
Digipeater upgrade          &lt;-----  Title of message
A LA6CU, LA1B, LA2D         &lt;-----  Copies to the people doing the job
A LA6GDA                    &lt;-----    "     "   "   "    "     "     "
I LA5RBA                    &lt;-----  LA5RBA is informed on the matter
C LA6IM @ LA6IM             &lt;-----  LA6IM receives a copy for updating his
                                    node-lists
H LA2GIA                    &lt;-----  LA2GIA receives a copy, but will not appear
                                    in the list of callsigns at the end of
                                    each message.
---------                   &lt;-----  After the last callsign, there must be a
                                    string of at least 5 '-' before the
                                    actual message.
                                    
Then follows the contents of the message, and end with Ctrl-Z or /EX.

As usual, the sender will receive a message saying that the copies were
made.  The messages to all the other callsigns will be identical, and look
like this:

Message via LA6CU MULTI-server (v3.00) :

Contents of message

============================================================================
For action       : LA6GDA, LA6CU, LA1B, LA2D.
For copy         : LA6IM.
For information  : LA5RBA.
============================================================================

All copies are identical, but A, C and I determines in which line in the
footnotes the callsigns will appear.  A callsign after an H will not 
appear in the footnotes.
