<P>
<PRE> The editor is validated for answering messages, with Alt-F6.
 
 The Tiny-Edit is started with the Alt-F5 command. Normal operation of the
BBS is maintained, the editing takes place in the console window, above the
monitoring area of the display.

 Most of the text files can be edited with this editor despite of its
simplicity. The most concerning drawback is the fact that the line length can
not be longer than 79 characters. The language files (xxxx.TXT) therefore
cannot be edited.

 Tabs are not generated and are presented on the display with a special
character.

 During the editing, the usual BBS command set are no longer available, they
are replaced by the tiny-edit commands.

 Upon activation of the editor, a dialog window ask for the filename to edit.

 The default directory is the directory "SYSTEM" as defined in INIT.SRV.

 Examples: FORWARD.SYS will edit SYSTEM\FORWARD.SYS
           FWD\F6FBB will edit SYSTEM\FWD\F6FBB

 It will be necessary to specify the full path for a file outside of the
default directory root or located on another disk drive. If only the drive
name is specified, the current directory on this drive is searched for the
filename.

 Example: C:INIT.SRV will edit C:\FBB\INIT.SRV (while the current directory
is c:\FBB).

 To edit a message, one should give the message number with a leading pound
sign ('#').

 Example : #42645 will edit the message number 42645.

 In case the edited file is a compiled one (I.E. FORWARD.SYS) it will be
compiled again after the termination of tiny-edit
