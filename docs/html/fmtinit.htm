 This file is the next file that FBB looks into during startup. This file
will be found in the main FBB-directory. All basic data is collected from
this file. Use your standard ASCII-editor to edit the following lines:
(all lines starting with # are comments)

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">In WinFBB,</FONT> INIT.SRV is created or updated with a small program called
<A HREF="toolinst.htm#INSTWFBB">INSTWFBB.COM</A>.  This program may also be run inside WinFBB, when WinFBB is
running, by clicking on Config at the top of the screen.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">In LinFBB</FONT>, INIT.SRV is created or updated with a small program called
<A HREF="toolinst.htm#INSTALL">INSTALL.SH</A>.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">In DosFBB,</FONT> INIT.SRV is created or updated with a small program called
<A HREF="toolinst.htm#FBBSETUP">FBBSETUP.EXE</A>.


This program is organized as pages of menus, and you can edit or change any
topic in your configuration.<FONT COLOR="#ff0000"> It is no longer necessary to edit the INIT.SRV</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">file manually.</FONT>

 The version of the software is now indicated in the first comment line. This
will allow further automatic updates.


 # FBB7.00
 #
 # Callsign and H-address (Do not include SSID !)
 LA1B.#BRG.NOR.EU
 #
 # SSID for the BBS
 0
 #
 # Qra locator
 JP20RH
 #
 # Qth (variable $c)
 Bergen
 #


 In the above lines you must replace the callsign and H-address with your own
BBS-call and H-address. You also must replace the SSID, that is the number
after the callsign. In LA1B-6, the 6 is the SSID. If you do not want any
SSID, type 0 here. You also must replace the QRA-locator with your own
locator (ask some other ham for help on this, if you don't know the BBSs QRA-
locator. Do NOT use the value from this example-file ! You also must replace
the QTH (don't make it too long...). If the QTH-name is short, you might add
the QRA-locator here too, like I have done.

 Next we have some filenames and path-names. These filenames and paths are
the same as used in the installation-procedure. If you did no changes in this
during installation, you will not need to change any of these now. 
Note the syntax, and note that directory-names MUST end with a \


 # Directory for files used by the BBS
 C:\fbb\system\
 #
 # Directory for messages
 C:\fbb\MAIL\
 #
 # Directory for binary-messages
 C:\FBB\BINMAIL\
 #
 # Directory for users DOS
 # Up to 8 drives may be specified, starting with drive A:
 # In this example drive A and B are not used, and therefore replaced
 # by a * each.
 *,*,C:\fbb\users\,*,*,*,*,*
 #
 # Directory for Yapp-files
 C:\fbb\users\yapp\
 #
 # Directory for DOCS
 C:\FBB\DOCS\
 #

 That was not so difficult ?

 Next, check the first-name of sysop, and the callsign of sysop.  Here are
MINE :

 # First-name of sysop
 Per
 #
 # Sysops callsign
 LA6CU
 #

 In the following line you CAN (not necessary) replace the ***** with a
callsign. If you do, that callsign will receive a copy of all SYSOP-messages
that arrives. You might want to put your own callsign there.
You may also include more than one callsign, separated by space.

 # Callsign (and route if needed) that shall have copy of messages
 # addressed to SYSOP
 # (*** for no copy, FD1CDC@FD1CDC.FMLR.FRA.EU if route)
 *****
 #

 No need to change this:

 # Path and filename for import-file
 \FBB\MAIL.in
 #

 Here you must first write the code for the kind of monitor you use, and then
you must have a number for how many minutes you want before the screen should
go blank, after no activity on the keyboard. In this example I have a CGA-
monitor, and my screen will go blank after 5 minutes since I last touched the
keyboard.

 # Type video:0=CGA, 1=EGA, 2=VGA Time before screen-blank.
 #
 0 5
 #

 Complete log gives you a log-file for every week. If you write NO here, no
log-file will be made. The log-file will appear in the directory named LOG.
Direct video uses fast BIOS-calls if you answer OK. If you plan to use
Desqview or Windows (with DosFBB, that is..), you must change it to NO. 
Indication of channels will normally be OK (that means that monitored 
information on screen will be more complete, with callsign of user before
every frame from each user, etc).


 # Complete log (OK or NO)
 OK
 #
 # Direct video (OK or NO)
 OK
 #
 # Indication of channels
 OK
 #

 Next we have Test Mode (NO - OK). If you type OK, the BBS will start, but
will not access the TNC(s). Use this the first times, to make sure that
everything works fine. When you are sure that all is well, connect the TNC(s)
and change this to NO. Restart the FBB, and now the TNCs will be used, as
normal.

 # Test-Mode (NO - OK)
 OK
 #

 Forward type FBB is faster and more efficient than standard MBL-type
forward. Use this whenever possible (OK). If you type NO, FBB-type forward
will not be allowed.  You may also use a parametre after OK/YES from this
list (add the ones you want):
  1  : A space is mandatory before the @ in a send message command
  2  : The length of the fields of a hierarchical address is not 
       tested to be 6 characters
  4  : The header line of a message is not truncated to the space before
       the 79th character
  8  : Header MBL/RLI
  16 : If there is no BBS field, the callsign of the BBS is sent to the PMS
  32 : Deletes the DATA messages sent to SYSOP
  64 : Don't use the BID recovered from headers and use a new one
  128: Accepts forwarding only from pre-declared BBS
  256: WP Messages are not held.
  512: XForwarding protocol has priority on FBB protocol.
 1024: Generation of an alternate BID like F6FBB-12345 (for dual BBS site)
 2048: Checksum unvalidated on XFwd.
 4096: Test of callsigns is less strict.  Allows all "callsign" as long as
       they have one figure (0-9) anywhere in the callsign.

 # Use (when possible) forward type FBB
 OK
 #

(or, you may include a numer, like     OK 2048     or whatever..)

 The same goes for compressed forward. Compressed forward
is very much faster, and should always be used. 
Parametre after "use compressed forwarding" give the options between 
compressed protocols :
1 = FBB compressed forwarding
2 = XFWD compressed forwarding
"OK 3"    allow both FBB and XFWD.

 # Use (when possible) compressed forward
 OK 3
 #

 Hroute update validation. If you type OK, the HROUTE look-up will be
validated. This takes some tens KB of memory. A route without hierarchical
extension will be changed to hierarchical route if found in the HROUTE.SYS
database. This  database  is  automatically  updated  while  receiving  
headers.

 # HROUTE look-up and database update validation
 OK
 #

 Information query. This ensures that the user will give his information.
This will be helpful for the update of the white pages database. If "OK",
the user will prompted until he answers to the queries.

 # User MUST give Name, HomeBBS, Qth and ZIPcode
 OK
 #

 Next we have 'Masque'. This is a default value that is given to all new
users when they log on the BBS for the FIRST TIME. Select the things you want
for all new users, and the values for them. If you f.ex. want all new users
to get Paging, and be in Guest mode, add 32 and 64, and put the result 96 in
the file. If you want none of the things listed here, put in a 0. The "see-
all_mail" mask will be active only if the user has the "read-all-messages"
security code (see behind).

 # First connection mask.
 # 0   : disable mask.
 # 1   : Excluded.
 # 2   : Local.
 # 4   : Expert.
 # 8   : Sysop.
 # 16  : BBS.
 # 32  : Pagination on
 # 64  : Guest.
 # 128 : Modem.
 <A NAME="LIST/READ"><!-- --></A># 256 : List/read all personal messages
 # 512 : Request for unproto beacon-lists allowed
 # 1024: Get list of new messages at each connect
 # Add up the values for your choices.
 1568
 #

 Next we have 'Security-codes'. Here we give 3 values. The first
 says what ALL users are allowed to do. The next says what sysops
 are allowed to do when they connect the BBS, and the third says
 what a sysop is allowed to do after he has successfully performed
 the SYS-command. The same applies here as above; choose the
 values you want and add them up.

 # Security-codes.
 # All users can:
 # 1  : Read all messages, including all personal messages.
 # 2  : Kill all messages.
 # 4  : Send SYS-command.
 # 8  : Use remote-sysop commands (edit, forward etc).
 # 16 : Edit labels in YAPP, FBBDOS, DOC.
 # 32 : Can delete files in YAPP and FBBDOS.
 # 64 : Have access to all gateways.
 # 128: Run dos-programs (command DOS in FBBDOS).
 # 256: Have access to the entire hard-disk.
 # 512: Have access to command /A (stop BBS) and /R (reboot PC).
 #
 # All: Sysop: Sysop after successful SYS-command:
   0    127    1023
#

<A NAME="Warning"><!-- --></A>Next we have warning-messages to sysop (mask):

 # 1   : Less than 1MB in disk
 # 2   : Error in system file (FORWARD, BBS, REJECT...)
 # 4   : Server error/warning
 # 8   : Ping-Pong warning
 # 16  : No-route warning
 # 32  : No NTS warning
 # 64  : Message file not found
 # 128 : Error in proposal
 # 256 : Message rejected in remote BBS
 # 512 : Message held in remote BBS
1023

 Next we have the time for cleanup of messages. This should be done in a low-
traffic hour, as the BBS is completely shut down during cleanup. Type also
the timeout-values you want, the default values here should be OK. Put also
in the number of hours (+ or -) between the PCs local-time and UTC.

 # Time (hour) for cleanup of messages
 # (Forced disconnection of all links at housekeeping time+15 min.)
 02
 #
 #
 # Time-out for normal use (minutes) and during forward (minutes)
 15 5
 #

 Max download-size (pr period) for Yapp and via modem, in kbytes.  0 0 will
disable it
 #
 100 500
 #

 # Hours +/- in relation to UTC
 0
 #

 Type how many callsigns you want (maximum) in each mail-beacon (variable
$Q). If you precede the number by a B, also bulletins to local users (type BN
or BY) will be broadcast in the mail-beacon. Like this:

 # Number of callsigns in mail-beacon
 B20
 #

 Number of lines in scroll-buffer may be changed. Just remember that they use
a lot of memory (each line takes 160 bytes of memory, but can be in high
memory), so I advice you to use these values:

 # Number of lines in scroll-buffer
 # User Console Monitoring
 1000    1000     1000
 #

 Leave this one alone:

 # Text for forward-header (variables OK), appears LAST in the R:line.
 # Please do not change the contents and the order of the fields except
 # the FBB$E field which is only an information and can be removed.
 # $c is the QTH as declared before in this file.
 [$c] FBB$E $$:$R
 #

 Next you must decide how many BIDs to keep. 
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">For WinFBB and LinFBB:</FONT>  Normally you will have enough memory.  So you may
use the max. However, I found 10000 to be a good value.
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">For DosFBB: </FONT>Depending on how much memory you have.  3000 is a good value,
but 10000 is better (hi).  

 # How many BIDs are saved (32000 max)
 3000
 #

 Leave the next one alone. This one means that bulletins that are older 
than (in this case) 30 days, will not be forwarded again from my BBS, and
will go directly to X-status. Be aware: a too low value here will cause 
problems for other BBSs that you forward to..

 # Lifetime for bulletins. Number of days from message is written
 30
 #

You should answer 1 for memory-cache, followed by the list of topics you 
want to load into memory. The BBS will do these operations very 
much faster.

 #
 # Use memory-cache ? 0=No, 1=Yes (preferred).
 # and optional list of topics to put in memory-cache
 #
 # Topics : BID = Bulletins or messages identifiers
 #          MSG = Message lists
 #          HIE = Hierarchical information
 #          SCR = Screen buffers
 #          WPG = White Pages database
 #          REJ = Reject/hold information
 #          FWD = Forwarding information
 #
 1 BID MSG WPG HIE SCR REJ FWD
 #

 List of routes to send WP update messages. First, keep this line blank until
you have a WP network available, then give the route(s) to send your updates.


 # List of routes to send WP messages
 #
 LA1B LA6CU
 #

 Zip code of the BBS. Give the post code area where is the BBS. Mandatory.

 # ZipCode of the BBS
 #
 31120
 #

 Here you will give the parameters allowing the list of messages in unproto
mode. This list can be interpreted by some terminal softwares (as TPK) and
greatly reduce the traffic on the local frequency.
 The first parameter is the maximum backward number. If a unproto user asks a
list which is lower than this number backward, he will be limited to this
parameter (IE: if the current message number is 20000 and a user asks the
list of the message 15000, he will be then limited to the 19500 if the
backward number is 500).
 The second parameter is the speed of the unproto updates given in seconds.
The frames will be sent with this period.
 The third parametre(s) have this meaning:
A = ACK messages
V = transit private messages
P = end-user private mail
M = subject is replaced by stars in private mail
    (Bulletins are always displayed)
Any unauthorized message will be unproto like
12345 #

 #
 500 5 VPA
 #

 Leave this lines alone, unless you are absolutely sure you want to change
it:

 # DRSI and TFPC interrupt (Hexadecimal, default FF and FE)
FF FE

 Then you have two optional programs of batches which are called at the end
of the initialization, and just before shutdown. If you don't need them, keep
these lines empty.


 #
 # BBS-UP program (default empty)

 #
 # BBS-DW program (default empty)

 #

 You can change these colours if you like:

 # Colour on texts :
 #
 # Black      : 0      Dark grey     : 8
 # Blue       : 1      Light blue    : 9
 # Green      : 2      Light green   : 10

 You may change these lines if you like. These are the servers that are
normally available in most FBB-BBSs, and they are automatically installed for
you from the diskettes. So you can leave them alone. Or you can disable them
with a # in front of each of these lines.

 Two built-in servers already exist, but you MUST declare them in this file
to make them available. As they are built-in, the program-name MUST be
replaced with stars.

 -----------
 # List of "servers" :

 # To Program-name Description

 Ok. That was the INIT.SRV file. This file is VERY important, so check and
double-check to make sure that you have it all OK.  The best way to check
it, is by using <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">INSTWFBB for WinFBB</FONT>, <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">INSTALL.SH for LinFBB</FONT> or 
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">FBBSETUP for DosFBB</FONT>.
