 This file will reside in SYSTEM-directory. This file is used for
automatically re-route messages. This file normally changes the @BBS-address,
but can also change the TO-field. You might not need so many callsigns etc.
here, but you should make one line with only your callsign after the @. In
that case the @BBS will be removed from messages to users in your own BBS.
For the first tries, it is enough to have one line starting with @, and then
your BBS-callsign. You can fill in the rest later.

##########################
#
# File SWAPP.SYS is used to change @BBS-adresses, to-adresses etc
# &gt; changes to-callsign
# &lt; changes from-callsign
# @ changes @BBS
# Combinations also allowed, like      &gt; LA8AK @ OZ2PAC.
#
# Other possibillities (recommended) is to delete own  @BBS.  That is done
# by putting own BBS-call in first column.
#
# Swapping may use hierarchy. For instance :
# @ F6FBB.FRA.EU @ F6FBB.FMLR.FRA.EU
#	Only the first full address will be swapped to the other
# @ F6FBB @ F6FBB.FMLR.FRA.EU
#	All F6FBB addresses will be swapped to the other
