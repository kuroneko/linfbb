# On line (TNC 6) multch is rose0 that is the device providing internal 
# interface with ROSE kernel module when an FPAC node is installed. 
# For example BBS or users wanting to connect this BBS via ROSE network routing should call F6XYZ-1 2080194501
# in order to let ROSE/FPAC network know how to relay the frames between ROSE nodes.
# TNC 5 line declares port AX.25<->UDP toward LAN local area network and Internet  
# If forward is done through AXUDP (TNC 5), forward file will state "P E"
# If forward is done through Telnet (TNC 4), forward file will state "P D" etc...
# TNC 4 declares telnet port 6300 --> COM 2. This line to be #commented if telnet not in use.
# MultCh: 0, axudp, uhfdrop,..., are the names of ports in /usr/local/etc/ax25/axports
