                KEP* | SPACE | PHASE3 | ISS | PCSAT | NASA)

7.04i
- POP/SMTP/NNTP ports may be unvalidated with the port value 0 in port.sys
#
#Com Interface Address (device)   Baud
 6   9         0:0:45f            0
#
- cron.sys - All ports need the value 0 instead of 9 (GATE 0 or YAPP 0)
- Added a CR after the messages header for POP

7.04l (F6BVP)
- includes patches for 2.6 kernel
- improvement for satellite documentation file status (see SATDOC doc)

7.04m (F6BVP)
- was buggy. DO NOT USE.

7.04n (F6BVP)
- compliant with 2.6 kernel
- base directory tree is now /usr/local/ by default (standard for AX25
  applications) except /usr/lib/fbb/

7.04o (F6BVP)
- lib/fbb moved to /usr/local/lib/fbb (for easier backup)
- script 20_epursat called during maintenance
- AMSAT declared as BBS in bbs.sys
- amsat.fwd declared in forward.sys
- satupdat (ajoursat) and satdoc included
- satupdat and satdoc doc files included
- HTML bbs documentation included (start with doc.htm)
- fbb script fbb.rc (start - stop -status - restart)
- /var/log/fbb.log log file

7.04p (F6BVP)
- this version only corrects compilation errors for xfbbX client.
- lesstif, lesstif-devel, libxpm and libxpm-devel packages must be installed.
- fbb has to be compiled first (and installed).
- then cd into fbb src/X11 directory and run make.
- give xfbbX and xfbbX_cl executable permission
  and copy both files into /usr/local/bin
- start fbb using rc.fbb script (or fbb) and run xfbbX client
  from an X11 console.

7.04q (F6BVP)
- Includes LA7ECA scan fix for PTCII pactor mode
- Some format fixup in init messages for easier debuging display when starting
  xfbbd with options -v -f

7.04r (F6BVP)
- This version has been successfully tested with 2.6.28 SMP kernel
  with a Core2 Duo CPU system.
  However default recommandation is still to add "nosmp" argument on kernel
  GRUB boot command line.
- zero length data are no more sent via snd_sck() and snd_tcp() functions.
- Please avoid using more than 40 channels in port.sys to prevent
  forwarding problems.
- There are probably still other unknown bugs in FBB. Any observation report
  is thus appreciated.

When FBB 7.05 is released it should include (in file sock_drv.c)
function sock_stat
/*
 * valid when ROSE module is patched for
 *      ax25_info_new structure
 *      struct ax25_info_struct_new ax25info;
 * if (ioctl (scan[canal].sock, SIOCAX25GETINFONEW, &ax25info) == 0)
 *
 */

7.04r.2 (F6BVP)
- less verbose debugging messages in /var/log/fbb.log
- Added usleep instructions to allow interrupts in tcp and sock drivers and
  reduce CPU load. It was sometime more than 14% and should be less than 1% now.

7.04r.2.1 (F6BVP)
- s_status was writing zero length frame. Corrected
- date structure corrupted in ibm.c caused  stack-smashing. Corrected.
- changed date format tm_year %100 in console.c to avoid stack overflow due
  to incorrect date format during FBB initialization.
- CFLAGS = -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -O2 -funsigned-char $(DEFS) -D__LINUX__
  -Wformat-security -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2  -DPROTOTYPES -I../include -fstack-check
  -fstack-protector-all (this DEBUG option is removed in distributed package)

7.04r.2.2 (F6BVP) is 7.04r6
- cree_bid() did not actually create WFBID.SYS and initialize it
  if file was missing. This could induce a segment violation. Corrected.
- In case of test or PRE versions the full release number is displayed:
  *********************************************************
  * XFBB Linux daemon version 7.04r-pre6 (Sep  18 2009) PID=9172
- Same full version number is used in /var/ax25/fbb/log/ files
  070522165800SI *** BBS Initialize
  070522170200SA *** BBS Online 7.04r-pre6
- By default 20_epursat script does not export satdoc and satupdat
  results to mail.

7.04r.6.1 (F6BVP)
- A bug was causing stack smashing with some kernels when message on hold
  was found. Corrected. Thanks to Charlie K4GBB, allowing intensive debugging
  on his LinuxLab machine and W4AKH-1 BBS.

7.04r.7 (F6BVP)
- Removed bugs in satdoc (SATellite DOCumentation utility) version 2.8.6
- AMSAT Weekly Satellite Report have two BID types : $ANS and $WSR.
  Updated Satdoc version 2.8.9
- Updated ajoursat - satupdat utility programm for satellites data base.
  Version is 1.87
- Doc files for both above utilies updated and renamed with 8 + 3 characters.
- register instructions removed (ignored by modern compilers)
- FBB log is now labeled with year date. For example:
  /var/ax25/fbb/log/fbblog.47 is now ~/fbblog09.47

7.04r.8 (Cathryn at junglevision dot com)
-segfaults in themes.c was crashing FBB with the nntp option when the bulletins
 are reset. When the user attemps to read a non-existent bulletin fbb crashes.

"This patch is for the Usenet server feature of FBB.  I put in code so that
it is now possible to post from the USENET connection.  The password checking
code is taken from the SMTP code.   I also put in a few changes to use
snprintf rather than sprintf to prevent buffer overflows.  I don't believe this
is all the places where this occurs, but I changed this when it was convenient.

I added a new function pop_quit to replace the code in this file where it was
sending a QUIT message to pop_process_read.  I found that the original code was
failing under some complicated circumstances, and that it was less confusing
to have a separate routine to quit directly to fix these crashes.  I also
fixed a crash in pop_send that occurred when reading large messages.

I updated the NNTP headers as follows.   I added the Newsgroups: line.  When you
reply message from a USENET client, it will send the output to TODAY@WW matching
the original distribution of the message.  I Removed the group name from
the Subject, and I canged the Message-ID to match the PBBS BID ID. This makes
the message lookup more robust in the case the themes.sys file changes."
 
7.04r.9 (F6BVP)
- A bug was causing stack smashing with DOS menu and long Linux file names.
  Corrected. Thanks to Peter ZL2BAU who reported this bug and helped
  tracing the cause.

7.04r.10 (F6BVP)
- channel timeout was not initialized at startup and after a timeout occured.
- "BBS Quit" now displays FBB version in log file. 
- Another bug was causing stack smashing with YAPP transfer and long Linux
  file names. Corrected. Thanks again to Peter ZL2BAU who reported this bug
  and helped tracing the cause.

7.04r.11 (F6BVP)
- Starting a local console FBB client xfbbC caused a segment violation
  if another console was already connected localy. Cured.
- corrected a compilation warning with xfbbC.c

7.04r.12 (Cathryn Mataga)
- SOCK_MAXCHAN (drv_sock.c) now set to (MAXVOIES)  This was set to 50, which
  was less than MAXVOIES, and the code was accessing data off the end of
  this table.  This was causing strange problems.  After I made this change
  the gateway function started working again. If anyone was having trouble with
  xfbbd and RF radio connections, this change may possibly fix their problem.
- Several minor changes designed to eliminate "Bad file descriptor" error
  messages.  These occurred at the time of housekeeping due to a minor bug.
  The messages actually turned out to be harmless, as far as I can tell.
- Only use the signal handler for signals that have functionality in the code.
  This is a simplification to prevent bugs. Other signals are set to SIG_IGN.

7.04r.13 (F6BVP)
- Compressed forward is repared on 64 bits Linux system. After bug removal
  it has been tested on 32 bits machines. For using compressed forward,
  do not use "N 1" argument in forward files.

7.04r14 (F6BVP)
- This version is without debugging messages going to log file.
  It will be renamed 7.05 if no major bug is reported.

7.04r14.1 (F6BVP)
- Three Patches from John Goerzen <jgoerzen@complete.org>
  "I'm working to get 7.04r13 into Debian.  As part of doing that, I've
  been reviewing the patches that Debian has in place to find which ones
  are still applicable.  I have these three to send you that I think are
  relevant. John".

7.04r14.2 (F6BVP)
- For some obscure reason LA7ECA scan fix for PTCII pactor mode included
  in 7.04q was missing. Applied again.
- While we are at it, lets include PACTOR CQ patches from DM3TT compilation.

7.05 (F6BVP)
- 7.04r14.2 is without major bug and can run on different systems.
  It is renamed 7.05

7.05a (F6BVP)
- A bug in xfbbd prevented the correct display of PG programs execution.
  Corrected.
- 7plus application via server and PG 7plserv, 7plus executable, 7pfbb script
  (50_7pfbb) was broken. Found 7plsrc.225 archives *** 7PLUS ASCII-
  Encoder/Decoder, (c) Axel Bauda, DG1BBQ *** It would not compile with
  Linux 2.6. Modified install_sh installation script. It performs all to have
  a complete 7plus files managment system. Small README file written
  and all utilities put into 7plus.tar.bz2 archive. Published.

7.05b (F6BVP)
- sh: message about c_filter removed even if this filter application
  is not present.
- Gustavo / I0OJJ signaled another failure concerning the D (info) feature which
  is on the (F) menu: the (D)irectories of *topics* are missed; the 'documents'
  may be regularly read but cannot be labeled by sysop. Corrected. In D menu,
  for labelling a file, Sysop command is D followed by file name, followed
  by a description texte no more than 30 characters.
  Users may navigate into doc directories with CD and list files using
  L command. Labels follow file names, and a user will read a document 
  file by entering its file number.

7.05b (F6BVP)
- Gustavo / I0OJJ sent a well documented series of bug report:
  1. Millennium bug (?) in the FBBDOS dates of files and directories.
     Dates where 20 years away! Corrected
  2. CANNOT CHANGE DIRECTORY BEYOND THE YAPP DIRECTORY with error message:
     path too long. Under investigation.
  3. PING sends a SERVER error report to the BBS Sysop while the ACK message
     is replied *correctly* OK:! Under investigation
  4. Bug description: two messages (simultaneously) issued by xfbb. A first
     *** SERVER ERROR *** issued by xfbb 7.05b and a second *CONCURRENT* message
     to callsign making the request (CORRECT OPERATION). Under investigation.

7.05c3 (F6BVP)
- Gustavo / I0OJJ reported : CANNOT CHANGE DIRECTORY BEYOND THE YAPP DIRECTORY.
  Corrected.
- Gustavo / I0OJJ reported that M, MH and MHA command crashed FBB. Corrected.

7.05c4 (F6BVP)
- Peter ZL2BAU reported that FBBDOS command cd .. was crashing FBB. Corrected.

7.05c5 (F6BVP)
- Charley K4GBB asked "With todays RTC clocks and NTP servers is there still
  a need to freeze the Housekeeping process because the last check failed?".
  Corrected. epurmess no more checks the date of epurmess.res.
- "Official libax25" introduced a new feature in ax25_ntoa() function removing
  SSID 0 in callsigns when present. This has been a major source of AX.25
  application programs dysfunctions. A new local function _ax25_ntoa()
  is used by FBB to avoid such issues.

7.05c6 (F6BVP)
- Gustavo / I0OJJ noticed that the *english.txt* file from the source archive
  did not conform anymore the *original* style, so xdfbb does not work with
  the 'outpost' and other new terminal programs.
  Gustavo fully revised the original "english.txt" and "english.hlp" files
  to overcome that lack.
  Thanks to Gustavo I0OJJ, both new english files are included in this version.
  SYSOPs are encouraged to copy these files from conf/lang/ directory into
  BBS ~fbb/lang/ directory.

7.05c7 (F6BVP)
- Corrected small bug in lzhuf warning message.

7.05c8 (F6BVP)
- Corrected small bug in lzhuf warning message again.

7.05c9 (F6BVP)
- First FBB week log number of year YY starts with number 0 (was 52) i.e.
  /var/ax25/fbb/log/fbblogYY.00 

7.05d (F6BVP)
- Charley K4GBB provided an improved fbb.sh start script (formerly rc.fbb).

7.05e (F6BVP)
- xfbbC client caused segmentation fault on RedHat distro.
- Makefile did not include -g flag, another possible source
  of segmentation fault.

7.05f (F6BVP)
- Compiling 7.05f will fail In Ubuntu 12.04 (and possible also in Ubuntu 11)
  and later because of the ncurses issue when it tries to link XfbbC.
  Bob VE3TOK provided a cure to avoid this issue. Now it will compile
  and link with gcc 4.5, gcc 4.6  and also with the older gcc 4.4
- Changed some debuging message
- removed packed attribute in pacsat.c that was generating unwanted
  compile warnings
- Added warning to send a message to Sysop when unregistered tcp client.
  Patch by Tom SP2L.
- Conditional compile on 64 bit systems to keep 32 bits FBB data format
  compatibility. Patch by Cathryn Mataga. Define THIRTYTWOBITDATA if you are
  bringing in data from 32-bit versions. This creates datafiles that match
  the origin documentation for FBB. They are not compatible with files created
  with 64-bit versions. Edit file include/fbb_serv.h and edit line 38 showing:
        /* #define THIRTYTWOBITDATA 1 */
        ^^                            ^^
  Remove these 4 marked characters if you want to keep your FBB data
  compatible 32 bit system.
7.05g (F6BVP)
- A few patches by Colin Tuckley G8TMV Debian developer:
  Add a basic manual page for fbbgetconf written by Joop Stakenborg
  <pa3aba@debian.org> and fix spelling mistakes. The two directories
  src/X11/res and src/X11/res/bitmaps needed to have their permissions changed
  to 755 so that they can be listed and inspected by the normal user.
  Add a Makefile in fbb main source file directory. 
  In src/Makefile LIBS   = -lm -lax25
- From F6BVP: moved conditional fbb_open() prototype to comply with Debian
  extended checking compiler.

7.0.6 (VE7FET)
