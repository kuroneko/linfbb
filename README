These are the sources of xfbbd (daemon version for LINUX) and their utilities.

1/ Compiling xfbbd, xfbbC client and its utilities with 2.6 kernel:
----------------------------------------------------
Do not run install.sh script directly. It is called by make.
To compile and install xfbbd you need to run a session as root
for writing privilege reasons.

- cd into fbbsrc.70?? directory
- update the variables at the beginning of, depending of your
  configuration. This must point to the ax25-utils include and librairies.
  Be sure to use at least the version 2.1.37b of ax25-utils.

AX25LIBPATH = /usr/local/lib
AX25INCPATH = /usr/src/linux/include/netax25

Enter command "make" without quotes ""

Be sure that an FBB daemon is not already running. Then 

Enter command "make install" without quotes ""

For the first installation start the BBS software using fbb script
with command
./fbb
It will check validity of FBB files tree and create missing files including configuration files.

For next BBS start use fbb.sh script. 

2/ Compiling the xfbbX X11 client :
-------------------------------
- this is only possible if you have a version of Motif installed.
- in Makefile uncomment the line :

all : client xfbbX_cl

- first, compile xfbbd daemon as indicated above.
- cd into X11 directory.
- run "make", this will build a xfbbX_cl binary. 
- xfbbX is a shell script which creates the resource file and runs xfbbX_cl.
- If you don't have Motif, xfbbX cannot be compiled.


3/ Fixes and evolutions :
-------------------------
Please, do not create new versions of code, this will make us impossible
to maintain and know what is the current version. Instead help us to develop
the code and fix the bugs. All fixes and evolutions will be welcome.

Please again, do not delete the copyright and author headers in the files.

If you didn't do it already, subscribe to the xfbb mailing list by sending a 
email to majordomo@f6fbb.org without title and with "subscribe xfbb" as the 
first line of text.

Then you will be able to send your fix, evolutions proposals and remarks to 
the mailing list.

1 : Sigterm received
2 : re-run (no housekeeping)
