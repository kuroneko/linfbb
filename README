These are the sources of xfbbd (daemon version for LINUX) and their utilities.

1/ Compiling xfbbd, xfbbC client and its utilities with 2.6 kernel from source:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To compile and install xfbbd you need to run a session as root
for writing privilege reasons.

- cd into fbb-70?? directory

*** If you are building from SVN repository code, you may need to 
*** run "./autogen.sh" first, in order to create the ./configure script.

Enter the command "./configure" to run the configure script.

Optionally, run "./configure --help" to see the various configure
options you can set.

Enter the command "make" to build the source.

Be sure that an FBB daemon is not already running. Then, 

Enter the command "make install".

*** If you are installing for the first time, run "make installconf". 
*** This will install default configuration files.
*** DO NOT run "make installconf" if you are upgrading a working system, 
*** as your configuration files WILL BE overwritten with defaults. 

For the first installation start the BBS software using fbb script
with command:
	fbb
It will check validity of FBB files tree and create missing files including configuration files.

For next BBS start use fbb.sh script. It is in /usr/local/share/doc/fbb/
Make it executable (chmod 755 fbb.sh) and move it somewhere on your system to call 
it automatically on start, or use it manually "fbb.sh start". 

2/ Compiling the xfbbX X11 client from source:
----------------------------------------------
Building the xfbbX client requires the following libraries to be installed:
	libx11-dev (provides -lX11)
	libxt-dev (provides -lXt)
	libxext-dev (provides -lXext)
	libxpm-dev (provides -lXpm)
	lesstif2-dev or libmotif-dev (provides -lXm)

or, the equivalent packages/libraries for your OS.

If the above libraries are available, xfbbX_cl will be built and installed 
automatically (you won't see a warning when running ./configure).

xfbbX is a shell script which creates the resource file and runs xfbbX_cl.

3/ Fixes and evolutions :
-------------------------
Please, do not create new versions of code, this will make us impossible
to maintain and know what is the current version. Instead help us to develop
the code and fix the bugs. All fixes and evolutions will be welcome.

Please again, do not delete the copyright and author headers in the files.

If you didn't do it already, subscribe to the xfbb mailing list by sending a 
email to xfbb@f6fbb.org without title and with "subscribe xfbb" as the 
first line of text.

Then you will be able to send your fix, evolutions proposals and remarks to 
the mailing list.

        /R : Reboot
        ---------------------------
        Immediate software exit (value 6)


Scripts :
---------

By default, the script directories are in /usr/local/lib/fbb/script.

When an exit value is received from xfbbd, all executable commands
(scripts or programs) included in the directory are executed
in alphanumeric order.


Script directories (by value) :
-------------------------------

        0 : error_return
        1 : end_session
        2 : rerun
        3 : maintenance
        4 : stop_system
        5 : sig_segv
        6 : reset
