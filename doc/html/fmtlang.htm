 This file is in the SYSTEM-directory. You do not need to change this file
for the first startups.

 First there are 3 numbers. The text in the file explains how to use them.

 Next there is a list of all available languages. These names must be the
same names as used in the .TXT and .HLP files in the directory called LANG.
So, there must be an <A HREF="fmttxt.htm#TXT">ENGLISH.TXT</A> and <A HREF="fmttxt.htm#HLP">ENGLISH.HLP</A> there, if ENGLISH is in
LANGUE.SYS file.

 After some comment-lines, there is a long list of prefixes, and the
corresponding number of language that each user will be presented with for
his first connect. The user himself, can change language later with OL-
command in the BBS.

 Remember, only the "Number in PC at the time" decides how much memory the
languages will use. All languages will be available anyway, but if more then
(in this case) 4 are in use at the same time, the BBS will swap the less used
language to disk, and load a new one from disk.
