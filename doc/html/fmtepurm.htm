 This file is also in the main FBB-directory. This is the file that controls
the lifetime of messages. Each night EPURMESS will be activated at the time
specified in <A HREF="fmtinit.htm">INIT.SRV</A>. Normally you will not need to change this, but if you
did any changes during installation, you must also change the same pathnames 
here. That goes for all lines that include a pathname.

 Next, you decide if you want to save "killed" messages in the OLDMAIL-
directory. If you do, write a 1 first, if you want to save old personal
messages, and another 1 if you want to save old bulletins.

 # Personal Bulletins (0=kill 1=archive in oldmail)
 0 0
 #

 Next we have the actual parametres (in days) for the lifetimes of bulletins
and personal messages. Let me just explain the letters in use here:
 P=Personal message
 B=Bulletin
 N=Not read
 Y=Had been read
 F=Forwarded (forwarded to all BBSs that should receive this msg)
 X=Expired (still readable, but will not be forwarded to other BBSs)
 K=Killed (readable only by sysop)
 A=Archived (same as killed, but will be deleted at once, or moved to
   OLDMAIL)

 I think this is self-explanatory:

 # Parametres in days:
 #
 # PARAMETRES FOR PERSONAL MESSAGES:
 #
 # PN -&gt; PX (days after message is written)
 30
 #
 # PY -&gt; PX (days after changed to Y)
 7
 #
 # PF -&gt; PK (days after changed to F)
 7
 #
 # PX -&gt; PK (days after changed to X)
 0
 #
 # PK -&gt; PA (days after changed to K)
 0
 #
 # PARAMETRES FOR BULLETINS
 #
 # BN -&gt; BX (days after the message is written)
 7
 #
 # B$ -&gt; BX (days after the message is written)
 7
 #
 # BY -&gt; BX (days after changed to Y)
 7
 #
 # BX -&gt; BK (days after changed to X)
 14
 #
 # BF -&gt; BX (days after message is written)
 14
 #
 # BK -&gt; BA (days after changed to K)
 0
 #
#
# Automatic generated return-messages for non-forwarded messages.
# Each line may be max 255 characters long.  Disable with only an 0.
#
# Timeout for valid forward-path (number of days + text, end with $W)
21 This message could not be forwarded, due to bad link.$W
#
# Unknown routing or wrong H-address (number of days + text, end with $W)
2 This message could not be forwarded, due to bad callsign or bad route.$W
#
# Max number of lines in a returned message:
10
#
------
#
# At the end of the file, you can have special lifetimes for special messages.
# In the example below, messages that are TO LA6CU will be 365 days old,
# messages FROM system will be 0 days, messages @LA will be 365 days. I have an
# # in front of them, this means they are disabled right now.
# List of lifetime-tests
#
# To/from/via Callsign Days
@  VEST   365
@  LA     365
&gt;  LA6CU  365
