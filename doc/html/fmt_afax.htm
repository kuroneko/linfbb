You may need several external drivers for your BBS.

The port-driver FBBCOMM.DRV is installed in Windows during the installation-
process of WinFBB.  

FBBCOMM.DRV is automatically installed in your Windows as you install WinFBB
from the diskette.  So there is nothing for you to do.  The driver is 
automatically installed into your SYSTEM.INI in the [boot] section as 
comm.drv=fbbcomm.drv.  If in doubt, you may want to check this.

 ESS is an async port driver optimized for FBB software. It can drive either
TNC2/PK232/clones or KAM.

 This small device driver is loaded as resident at the beginning of the
machine initialization (TSR).

 One ESS handles one serial line and makes use of one IRQ.

 The COM number, the address of the serial interface and the IRQ number are
given as parameters appended to the command line. The address should be given
as a FOUR digit hex number.

 Example : Install ESS for COM1 at hex 03F8 and using IRQ 4 :
 ESS 1 03F8 4

 If only the COM number is specified, the address and the IRQ will default to
the standard DOS value. Thus ESS 1 would have had the same effect than the
example.

 Any address or IRQ number can be specified. Carefully check that the address
and the IRQ number match the board you intend to use, special attention
should be given to the IRQ number which should not already be used by another
peripheral device in the machine. On a PC the IRQ's can not usually be
shared.

 Should there be more than one port to handle, several ESS can be cascaded.
The IRQ should be different for each ESS, except for the case in which the
interrupt sharing is supported by the serial card used.

 Example :

 ESS 1 03F8 4
 ESS 2 02F8 3

 This sequence will load ESS's for COM1 and COM2.

 ESS accommodates also the muxing arrangement of serial ports.

<B> must be used with the MUX ! </B>

ESSKAM works exactly as <A HREF="#ESS">ESS.COM</A>, but only for Kantronics Kam TNCs.

 FBBIOS is a serial line driver dedicated to the usage of a PSTN modem.
Binary as well as ASCII file transfer are supported with the XMODEM protocol.

 FBBIOS handles one serial line, one IRQ is required. The COM number, the
address of the serial interface and the IRQ number are given as parameters
appended to the command line, the address should be specified in FOUR hex
digits.

 Example : Install FBBIOS for COM1 at hex 03F8 and using IRQ 4 :
 FBBIOS 1 03F8 4

 If only the COM number is specified, the address and the IRQ will default to
the standard DOS value. Thus FBBIOS 1 would have had the same effect than the
example.

 Any address or IRQ number can be specified. Carefully check that the address
and the IRQ number match the board you intend to use, special attention
should be given to the IRQ number which should not already be used by another
peripheral device.

 On a PC the IRQ's can not usually be shared.

 If the modem in use is at the HAYES standard, FBBIOS can modify the line
speed according to the one of the incoming call connection. In this case the
parameter 'A' should be appended to the command line to activate this
feature. This is not true with some buffered modems using a junction with a
settled speed.

 Example : FBBIOS 1 03F8 4 A

 Upon receipt of the string CONNECT 1200 or CONNECT 2400, the driver will
adjust its speed to the incoming call.

 From version 1.30, FBBIOS.COM can run up to 56 KBauds. Be sure that your
computer is fast enough !
