This is an ettempt to explain difficult/strange words from this documentation.
Send all your suggestions for this page to <A HREF="mailto:perolsen@bergen.mail.telia.com">LA6CU</A>.

Autobin     : A protocole for transfer of binary files via radio-ports.
              Supported by several terminal-programs.

DLL         : DLL is Dynamic Link Library. This is used in the windows 
              environment and allows a program to attach a library which 
              holds some code during the session or only during a phase of
              a program (like filters in FBB). This allows a very fast and
              efficient mechanism. Also DLL may be compact.

DPMI        : Dos Protected Mode Interface.
              It enables Ms-Dos based applications to access all the 
              extended memory installed in the PC maintaining system 
              protection.  DosFBB uses it, so it is not limited to the 
              memory below 1Mb and PG/SERVERS have more that 500Kb of  
              memory to run.

GPF         : Windows error-message.  Means that the BBS has performed an 
	      action that has caused a General Protection Failure.

VXD         : VXD is more complex. I don't know exactly but they are 
              something like drivers for Windows using 32 bit code.

YAPP        : "Yet Another Packet Program".  Originally a program by WA7MBL
              for simple transfer of binary files on packet radio.  The 
              protocol from his program is widely known as the YAPP-protocol.

Xforward    : Another kind of compressed forward, implemented in FBB.
