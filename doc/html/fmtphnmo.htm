<PRE> The FBB software allows the connection of a telephone modem on a serial
port.

<IMG SRC="../cyan.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14"><A NAME="Driver"><!-- --></A><BIG><B>Driver:</B></BIG>

The modem must be declared in PORT.SYS.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">In WinFBB</FONT> the necessary driver is in <A HREF="fmtdriv.htm#FBBCOM">FBBCOMM.DRV</A>.  This driver replaces
the original COMM.DRV supplied by WIndows.  

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">In DosFBB</FONT> it is necessary to use the <A HREF="fmtdriv.htm#FBBIOS">FBBIOS.COM</A> program. This driver 
performs BBS to Modem interfacing. It is therefore necessary to load FBBIOS
prior to BBS start up. A line FBBIOS will be added ahead of APPEL.BAT file.
See below an example of the APPEL.BAT file.
Of course, the FBBIOS used will have to match the serial port on which the
modem is to be connected (address and IRQ).

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">In LinFBB</FONT> it is necessary to compile the Linux Kernel with SLIP 
(serial line).

The modem-driver will modify the RS232 speed according to the CONNECT info
received from the modem :

 CONNECT 1200 set the driver to 1200 Baud.
 CONNECT 2400 set the driver to 2400 Baud.

 The driver is reset to the default speed rate (specified in <A HREF="fmtport.htm">PORT.SYS</A>) at
disconnect.

 At connect, the text ; "xxxx BBS. Phone Access" is sent by default. This can
be modified by creating a file <A HREF="fmttxt.htm">MODEM.ENT</A> in the SYSTEM directory.

 You can specify in the PORT.SYS file that you accept connections, even if
the user is not registered. In this case, the connection will be "read-only",
the user has only a read only-access, he cannot download files or write
messages, except to the sysop.

 When a non-registered user is connected, he will be signified that he only
has a "read only access", and will be prompted to go on. If he answers "Y",
he will go to the BBS menu, else he will be asked again for a callsign.


<IMG SRC="../red.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14"><A NAME="Type"><!-- --></A><BIG><B>Type of modem:</B></BIG>

 Various experiments have been carried out with several different kinds of
(external, or internal cards) modems. If possible, modems at 14.400 or
better 28.800 bps should be used; the modem speed is to be declared in
PORT.SYS. Some modems can work different speeds, with an internal
speed conversion between the modem and the computer. For example, the modem
can transmit and receive on the telephone line at 14400 bps and talk to the
PC at 19200 bps.

 If the modem uses the HAYES protocol, the INITTNCx.SYS file must hold the
correct HAYES init lines for the modem.


<IMG SRC="../yellow.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14"><A NAME="Protocol"><!-- --></A><BIG><B>Protocol:</B></BIG>

 The configuration used is 1 start bit, 8 data bits, 0 parity, 1 stop bit,
that is to say 10 bits words during the transmission.

 The Minitel standard is not supported (7 bits, even parity).

 The software being parametered by default in 8 bits, it was not possible to
modify this protocol, as the binary file transfers are carried out on 8 bits.

 NB.: FBBIOS/FBBCOMM.DRV handles XON/XOFF protocol during the transmissions.

<IMG SRC="../green.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14"><A NAME="Wiring"><!-- --></A><B><BIG>Wiring for external modems:</BIG></B>

 The modem must be able to tell the BBS that a call has been detected with
the remote modem carrier detection. This is the reason why all the RS232
signals are used by the BBS. The RS232 cable has to be wired up pin to pin
with no inversion: pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 20, and 22 of the DB25
connector.


<IMG SRC="../grey.gif" WIDTH="14" HEIGHT="14"><A NAME="Usage"><!-- --></A><BIG><B>Usage:</B></BIG>

 BBS users are not authorized to connect the BBS through a modem as per the
default settings.

 The SysOp must declare the modem users. To do it, perform a user edition (EU
call) and put M (for Modem) then W pass_word. A password made of the three
last letters of the callsign can be attributed for the first connect. Then
the user will be able to change it through the NP command. The authorized
callsigns can be listed by the DM command.

 When a modem call occurs, once the modulations have been detected, the modem
advises the BBS that a connection is effective on the telephone line. Then
the BBS asks for the caller's call sign and password.

 The user is granted three tries before being disconnected. If everything is
all right, the user can access the same commands like connected on a radio
channel, he will have to disconnect using the B command.

 The log file is maintained for the connections through the modem channel.
Keep in mind to add a line in the LOGFBB.CNF file for the modem calls to be
processed in the stats analysis by LOGSTAT.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">For WinFBB:</FONT>
<A HREF="fmtdriv.htm#FBBCOMM">FBBCOMM.DRV</A> is already installed when Windows is started.  So there is no
more driver to install for the modem.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">For LinFBB:</FONT>
Make sure you have compiled the Linux kernel with SLIP (serial line),
or if you compiled SLIP as module you must load this.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">For DosFBB:</FONT>
 Example of APPEL.BAT with FBBIOS for a modem connected to COM3/IRQ4 :
 echo off
 break off
 echo Press ^C to interrupt !
 sleep 3
 fbbios 3 03E8 4
 serv %1
 etc........

<A NAME="FORWARD"><!-- --></A><B>Example of  FORWARD.SYS  file</B>  to  forward  via  modem.  A  protocol with
correction (like MNP) must be used to avoid any modifications of texts. The
HAYES command ATDT dials the line, and when the connection is established,
the callsign (preceded with a "." to avoid echoing) is sent twice and then
the password. The callsign is sent twice in case of a problem the first time.
^M is the &lt;return&gt; variable.
