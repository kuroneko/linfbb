 Statistical analysis software for the <A HREF="fmtlog.htm">FBBLOG</A> file written by FC1MVP.

 The configuration file for this software is in the text file LOGFBB.CNF,
which should be located in the same directory.

<BIG><B> LOGFBB.CNF file layout :</B></BIG>

 This file is made of several lines indicating:

 - BBS Callsign
 - the name of the SysOp port, a comment.
 - The abbreviated name of the 1st port, a comment.
 - The abbreviated name of the 2nd port, a comment.
 - and so on until the last port (8 ports maximum).
 - Three stars (***) at the beginning of the line means the end of the ports.
 - The BIOS screen access option.

 The BBS callsign must have 6 characters maximum. It will be truncated should
it be longer.

 The abbreviated port name may have up to 10 characters, it is recommended to
limit at 4 (ex VHF1 or HF2).

 A comma separates the abbreviated name from the comment which follows it,
without any space. The comment may have 10 characters too (frequency).

 At the end of the comment, it is possible to add a comment which is internal
to the CNF file, and which will not be used elsewhere, using the ":" as a
separation.

 If the BIOS line has a NON at the beginning, the screen access will be
direct. The word OUI means that the screen access is made via the BIOS. The
direct access improves the processing speed by 50 percent but is careless
with DesqView.

<BIG><B> Example of LOGFBB.CNF file:</B></BIG>

 F6FBB : BBS name.
 SYSOP,at keyboard : port name @ , comment.
 VHF, 144.675 : Port A , comment.
 VHF, 145.275 : Port B , comment.
 UHF, 430.675 : Port C , comment.
 HF, 21.107 : Port D , comment.
 SHF, 1299,675 : Port E , comment.
 MODEM, Telefone : Port F , comment.
 *** End of ports definition.
 NON : Screen access through BIOS (OUI) or
 Direct (NON).

<BIG><B> Software limitations :</B></BIG>

 The software is able to handle a log file within the following limits:

 - Maximum number of days : 35, or 5 weeks if you chain 5 log files.

 - Maximum number of channels: 50

  - Maximum number of ports : 8+1, corresponding to ports A to H handled by
the BBS and the SysOp keyboard "port".

 - Maximum nr of callsigns : 300 (This is not the number of the call signs
known by the BBS, but the number of calls which were used the BBS during the
log period.

 In case an overflow occurs, the mention AUTRES for the callsign and 99 for
the day will be displayed in the corresponding areas.

 Regarding the forward efficiency, only the stations which have actually
forwarded will be given a value, the others will be mentioned "nc".

<B><BIG>Usage :</BIG></B>

 On the same diskette (or the same disk) there should be at least the program
LOGSTAT.EXE, the config file LOGFBB.CNF and enough disk free space for the
result files to be created. The log file may stay on another diskette.

 For the startup you should type in LOGSTAT FBBLOG.nn (nn is the number of
the week) or A:FBBLOG.nn (if the file is located on A:)

 The results are recorded into the files LOG.@, LOG.A ... LOG.T being the
total of the logs.

<BIG><B>Archiving :</B></BIG>

 A suggestion: you should better archive your FBBLOG.nn file rather than the
LOG.x files. You should ZIP them (or ARC or LZH) with the name LOG990nn.ZIP
(.ARC or .LZH) with 990 standing for 1990 (000 will be for 2000...) and nn is
the number of the week.

<BIG><B>Log structure :</B></BIG>

 The number of resulting files created is equal to the number of ports of the
BBS plus 2. The 2 supplementary files correspond to the console port and the
sum of the various ports as being the total result.

 The first log, named LOG.@ corresponds to the SysOp log (console), the last
one, named LOG.T is the summation of the ports. The files LOG.A to LOG.H are
the logs of the various ports.

 Obviously, if a port has not been used, the corresponding file will not be
created.

 For each LOG.x file, you find in the following order:

 - Diary of the connections per day (y-axix) and the time (x-axix) with the
daily total at the end of the line and the hourly total at the bottom of each
column.

 - The total connection time: it is the sum of the connection times of each
user. For the LOG.T file, the total connection time per channel will also be
given.

 - Mean time per connection : this is the total connection time divided by
the number of connections.

 - Mean time per user : total connection time divided by the number of users.

 - Number of killed messages : self explanatory.

 - Number of read messages : idem.

 - Number of users.

 - A matrix of forwarded messages per day (y-axix) and per hour (x-axix) is
made like before. This matrix will not appear if there has not been at least
one forward on this port.

 - Number of forwarded messages: number of messages sent to another BBS or
PMS.

 - Number of messages received in forward: number of messages transmitted by
other BBS in forward.

 - Number of messages received in back-forward: number of messages received
from another BBS when forwarding towards it.

 - Number of messages refused as already received.

 - An array giving the number and the size of the messages received from or
sent to another BBS and the efficiency in Bits/s (Max 1200 !).

 The BBS's are sorted by alphanumeric order, and the efficiency indication
appears for callsigns having conducted only forwarding operations. This
matrix will not appear unless there has been at least one BBS forwarded.

 - A matrix of the main functions utilized, with on the y-axix the callsigns
sorted by alphabetical order, and on the x-axis the total time of connections
in minutes, the number of connections, and the various functions used (see
the comment following the array).

 In the LOG.T file, the X.F column (forced disconnection entered by the
SysOp) is replaced by the number of killing commands. At the end of each
column is the compound sum.

<BIG><B>Log of a specific station.</B></BIG>

 - The LOGCALL program yields generation of a log for a specific station

 The principle of operation is the same as for LOGSTAT, except that a
supplementary calling parameter is required to define the station.

 LOGCALL FBBLOG.33 FE1ZZZ

 The generated file will be of the same format as the FBBLOG, but it will
enclose only the lines specific to the callsign. The name of the file will
match the format FE1ZZZ.LOG, if the requested callsign is FE1ZZZ.

 While executing LOGSTAT FE1ZZZ.LOG, you will have the statistics related to
that station (in the LOG.A, LOG.B,...).

 If you specify the SSID, you will create a log corresponding only to the
callsign and the specified SSID. Ex:

 LOGCALL FBBLOG.33 FE1ZZZ-2

 Editing the file FE1ZZZ.LOG will allow you to display all the commands sent
by that station.
