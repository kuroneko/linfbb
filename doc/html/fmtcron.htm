 This file is in the SYSTEM directory. The BBS looks in this file once every
hour. If the hour and date is right, the BBS will execute the commands in
this file.

 DOS-programs are run with X or D command, like X DOTHIS.EXE or D DOTHAT.EXE.
When running BAT files, a COMMAND.COM is automatically first sent. That needs
some more memory.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">In DosFBB</FONT> the the screen is saved with D-cpmmand, and reappears after the 
program has terminated.  With X the program will not write to the screen.
