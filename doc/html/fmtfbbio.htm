 FBBIOS is a serial line driver dedicated to the usage of a PSTN modem.
Binary as well as ASCII file transfer are supported with the XMODEM protocol.

 FBBIOS handles one serial line, one IRQ is required. The COM number, the
address of the serial interface and the IRQ number are given as parameters
appended to the command line, the address should be specified in FOUR hex
digits.

 Example : Install FBBIOS for COM1 at hex 03F8 and using IRQ 4 :
 FBBIOS 1 03F8 4

 If only the COM number is specified, the address and the IRQ will default to
the standard DOS value. Thus FBBIOS 1 would have had the same effect than the
example.

 Any address or IRQ number can be specified. Carefully check that the address
and the IRQ number match the board you intend to use, special attention
should be given to the IRQ number which should not already be used by another
peripheral device.

 On a PC the IRQ's can not usually be shared.

 If the modem in use is at the HAYES standard, FBBIOS can modify the line
speed according to the one of the incoming call connection. In this case the
parameter 'A' should be appended to the command line to activate this
feature. This is not true with some buffered modems using a junction with a
settled speed.

 Example : FBBIOS 1 03F8 4 A

 Upon receipt of the string CONNECT 1200 or CONNECT 2400, the driver will
adjust its speed to the incoming call.

 From version 1.30, FBBIOS.COM can run up to 56 KBauds. Be sure that your
computer is fast enough !
