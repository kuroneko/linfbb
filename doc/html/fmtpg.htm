 PG programs are in the PG subdirectory. They are small programs allowing
interactivity with the user.

 COM or EXE programs can be called.

 PG programs must be little as the amount of memory is limited and fast
because the multitasking is stopped during its activity.

 To run a PG program and start a session, the user must type the command PG
followed by the name of the program. The PG command alone gives the content
of the PG subdirectory. The PG program is particularly developed for FBB
software but can be an interface to a standard program.

 Each time a complete line (up to the return character) is received, the PG
program is called with some arguments including a level number. This number
is incremented each time the program is called in the same PG session. The
first time the level number will be 0.

 The line arguments given to the PG program are :

- Callsign (format as F6FBB-8).
- Level number (0 is the first time, up to 99).
- Flags of the user (binary number as user's mask of <A HREF="fmtinit.htm">INIT.SRV</A>).
- Record number of the user in <A HREF="fmtinf.htm">INF.SYS</A>.
- Received data (each word is a new argument).

 The PG program ends with an exit value. This value is very important and
tells the BBS what to do :

 0 : end of session and return to the BBS menu.
 1 : the program will be called again and the level number is incremented.
 2 : the user will be disconnected.
 3 : the receive data will be sent as a BBS command and return to BBS.
 4 : the receive data will be sent as a BBS command, level incremented.
 5 : the program will be called again, but the level is not incremented.

 The data sent by the PG program to the standard output will be sent to the
user. This allows a real interactivity between the user and the PG program.

  Here is an example of a small program :

/*
 * TST_PG.C
 *
 * Little test program of "PG" command for FBB BBS software.
 *
 * (C) F6FBB 1991.
 *
 * FBB software 5.14 and up.
 *
 *
 * This program echoes to the user what he types
 * or executes a BBS command preceded by "CMD"
 * until "BYE" is received
 */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int  i;
  int  level = atoi(argv[2]);        /* Get level from argument list   */

                                     /* and transform it to integer    */
  if (level == 0) {                  /* Is level equal to 0 ?          */
                                     /* This is the first call         */
    printf("Hello %s, type BYE when you want to stop !\n", argv[1]);
    return(1);                       /* program will be called again   */
  }

      printf("Ok, bye-bye\n");

    else {
      printf("You told me : ");      /* These are other lines          */
      for (i = 5 ; i &lt; argc ; i++)   /* List line arguments            */
      printf("%s ", argv[i]);        /* sent by user                   */
