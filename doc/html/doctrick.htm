(Appendix 8)
<P>
<PRE>
 This rubric is yours, more than mine. I'll try to insert there all tricks
you will tell me.


<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Only for DosFBB:</FONT>
<B>Using DesqView (c).</B>
-------------------
 There is no particular problem when using DesqView. The minimum window size
is 500 KB. You MUST use communication drivers, like ESS, COMBIOS or MBBIOS,
as the software does not dispose of the whole process time.


<B>Communication errors displaying.</B>
 -------------------------------
 An error counter can be displayed 
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">in WinFBB:</FONT> after the word "Resync" on the screen
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">in DosFBB:</FONT> just right of the date, on the first line of the screen.
If you are using TNC2 with WA8DED software, these errors can be minor, but
with PK232, error recovery is more difficult, and the system may reboot.

 With a correct operation of your system, this counter will not appear, or
exceptionally. If errors are displayed, they can result from :

 - Using DOS 4.0 or 5.0 : The keyboard driver of these versions is very slow.
You must use the ESS driver for RS232 (or COMBIOS).

 - A too hight baudrate, or RS232 defective cables. The baudrate can be
selected down to 4800 Bds. It is not a good idea to go down 4800 Bds, as the
performance of the software should be lower.

 - Change the LM324 fitting out some TNC RS232 line drivers by a TL074 or
TL084.

 - HF detection in the TNC. Errors and resynchronizations will appear when
the transmitter is running. There is no real cure, you must investigate.

 You can also use communication drivers like ESS, COMBIOS or MBBIOS if you
are not still using them.


<B>Repeat the last message number.</B>
--------------------------------
 The last message number displayed, read, killed, etc... can be utilized
again with the # (pound) character. This short-cut allows as for an example
to read a message after a list or to suppress it just after its reading.

 Example :

 F6FBB BBS &gt; R 12351
 The message is displayed ...
 F6FBB BBS &gt; K #
 Message #12351 killed.
 F6FBB BBS &gt;


<B>Problems with BPQ running as a Node !</B> (OZ1CBQ)
-------------------------------------

If you are using BPQ running as a node together with FBB you may have problems
if your node ar linked to other nodesystems as TheNet, TheNetNode, X-net,
RMNC, FlexNet, etc.

BPQ seems to have a compatibility problem with these nodesystems causing some
hangups during incoming connects via the nodesystem.
The problem starts with lowering the available buffers and at last the 
system is hanging until a reboot has been done.
Only cure for the time being is to run BPQ as a SWITCH only without nodeupdate
(NODE=0 in BPQCFG.TXT) only allowing level_2 traffic.

This brings another problem:
When FBB runs together with BPQ running as a level_2 switch, it is only 
possible to have outgoing forward on two channels at the time.
One channel using the callsign and one channel using the alias as first call
in the forwardfile.

Example 1.st outgoing forward channel:

C C SWITCH
C C 1 OZ7BOX-2    ; Callsign of the BPQ-switch
C C ....          ; Other connects

Example 2.nd outgoing forward channel:

C C SWITCH
C C 1 ESBOX       ; Alias_name of the BPQ-switch
C C ....          ; Other connects


<B>PMS forwarding:</B>
<B></B>---------------

In INIT.SRV there is a flag 128 in the FBB-type-forward section.  If this flag
is set, only PMS-users that have been declared with the F-flag in the EU-command
(Edit User) will be able to up/download messages to/from the BBS.  The same
users should also have the U flag set (in EU-command) to enable them to send
unproto resync requests to the BBS.


<B>Display looks wrong (Only WinFBB):</B>
----------------------------------

If you get a wrong display of the windows of WinFBB, halt the software,
delete windows\winfbb.ini and rerun the software.
