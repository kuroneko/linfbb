<PRE>The TFWIN.INI must be edited to match the comport configuration ie port 
speed etc. 

TFWIN.INI can also define things like txdelay for hf or highspeed ports.
It is possible to program most of the PORT specific parameters in a
INITTNCn.SYS (first TFWIN port) with "DRSI-like" P line (look at the FBB
doc for DRSI).

This is my port.sys for TfWin DLL... Think that Multch (as usual) must
match with the port number of TFWIN.INI

The TFWIN.INI is using COM1 as "port 0 (MultCh 0)"

As it is a Windows application, the com1 MUST be known (and available) from
Windows !

# FBB7.00
# File for programming of channels and TNCs.
#
# Ports : How many ports (COM1, COM2, Etc...)
# TNCs : How many TNCs and modems in use. With multiplexer
# there can be up to 4 TNCs per port.
#
#Ports TNCs
 1     1
#
#In WinFBB ONLY THESE interfaces are available:
# Interface : 2 = BPQ-node (BPQ in AA4RE-mode)
#             4 = DRSI
#             5 = TFPCR/TFPCX interface.  Interrupt MUST be 0xFD
#             6 = Windows-driver, replaces both ESS, ESSKAM and FBBIOS.
#             7 = TCP/IP.  Needs WINSOCK.DLL.  Put port-address as 17.
#                 TNC-emulation is T (see below) 
#             8 = TFWin.dll
# BEWARE: The old interface 1 and 3 will NOT be used in WinFBB.  Interface 6
#         replaces both.  (FBBCOMM.DRV).  Neither ESS nor FBBIOS can be
#         used with WinFBB !
#
#In LinFBB ONLY this interface is available:
# Interface   9 = Linux.  Can work via serial port (D),via AX25 domain
#                 socket (X) or via Telnet port (T).
#
#In DosFBB ONLY THESE interfaces are available:
# Interface : 1 = Use external COMBIOS-driver (MBBIOS, ESS etc)
#             2 = BPQ-node v 4.05 and up (BPQ in AA4RE-mode)
#             3 = Telephone-modem with FBBIOS
#             4 = DRSI card with driver
#             5 = TFPCR/TFPCX interface.  Interrupt MUST be 0xFD
#
# Address   : Address of port in hexadecimal (Needed for multiplexer).
#             In LinFBB:
#             Address is the device name (/dev/cua0).
#             Be sure you have the rights to access to the device (rw-rw-rw-).
#             When using kernel AF_AX25 socket, address is not used.
#             When using Telnet, address is the Telnet port in Hex (Hex 17 = Telnet port 23)
# Baud      : Ports baud rate. Ignored by BPQ, kernel AF_AX25 socket and Telnet.
#
# Use same number of lines as number of ports.
#
#Com Interface Address (device)   Baud
 1   8         3f8          9600
#
# TNC     : Number on TNC in use.  Use 0 for file-forward !
# NbCh    : Number of channels I want to use in the TNC.
#           Maximum available channels depend on firmware.
# Com     : Number of the COM-port. Com1, Com2 etc.
# MultCh  : Number of channel if port-multiplexer is used, otherwise 1.
#           In DRSI use values from 0 to 7, by KAM use 1/VHF and 2/HF.
#           When using kernel AF_AX25 socket in Linux, MultCh is the
#           interface name (eg: ax0)
# Paclen  : PACLEN on this TNC.
# Maxframe: The maximum nb of frames the TNC will send at a time.
# NbFwd   : Number of channels for OUTGOING forward at same time.
# MxBloc  : Size of forward-block in kb.
# M/P-Fwd : Minute of the hour for start of forward, and period
#           (how many minutes between each forward-start).
# Port mode, one of these:
#           B : BBS-mode.
#           G : "Guest"-mode.
#           U : Normal-mode.
# Type host-mode, one of these:
#           D : WA8DED
#           K : KAM hostmode.  Must use ESSKAM driver.
#           P : PK-232
#           Q : BPQ v 4.x
#           T : Ethernet/TCP-IP
#           X : AX25 domain socket (for Linux)
# Addition: One or more of these letters can be used too:
#           L : Send unproto beacon after each arriving mail.
#           M : Telephone-modem.
#           Y : Yapp allowed on this QRG.
#           W : Gateway allowed TO this QRG.
#           R : Modem port allowed in Read-only mode.
# Freq.   : Text to describe this port (max 9 characters, no space)
#
# Same number of lines as TNCs:
#
#TNC NbCh Com MultCh Pacln Maxfr NbFwd MxBloc M/P-Fwd Mode Freq
