<BIG><B>PORT.SYS (\FBB\SYSTEM).</B></BIG>
<PRE>
First, be aware of this useful feature:
If PORT.SYS does not exist, FBB looks for 
PORT_D.SYS (for DosFBB)
PORT_W.SYS (for WinFBB)
PORT_L.SYS (For LinFBB)
So it is possible to have for example DosFBB and WinFBB files in the PC
at the same time.  This is useful at sites where you want to change
from WinFBB to DosFBB from time to time..

I have divided this section in two parts:
1   :  <A HREF="#Simple">Simple instruction (for first-time setup).</A>

2   :  <A HREF="#Advanced">Advanced setup, with more details.</A>
2.1 :  <A HREF="#BPQ">For BPQ.</A>
2.2 :  <A HREF="#DRSI">For DRSI.</A>

<B><BIG>1: Simple instruction (for first-time setup).</BIG></B>

 This file is found in the directory called SYSTEM (if you used my default
directory-names). In this file we decide what kind of TNCs to use, how many
available channels etc. You must do several changes here, and be very careful
that you do all changes correctly. If you don't, the BBS cannot operate
properly.  Remember that a line starting with # is a comment-line, and the
BBS ignores these lines.

 # FBB7.00
 # File for programming of channels and TNCs.
 #
 # Ports : How many ports (COM1, COM2, Etc...)
 # TNCs : How many TNCs and modems in use. With multiplexer
 # there can be up to 4 TNCs per port.
 #
 #Ports TNCs

 Next you must type one complete line of parametres for each COM-port you
use. You must be careful to use the correct values here.

Here are the valid interfaces for DosFBB and WinFBB:

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">For WinFBB:</FONT>
The mostly-used interface for WinFBB is 6.  This interface replaces ESS,
MBBIOS etc and FBBIOS.  The driver is FBBCOMM.DRV, which is installed 
during the installation-process.
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">In WinFBB ONLY THESE interfaces are available:</FONT>
# Interface : 2 = BPQ-node (BPQ in AA4RE-mode)
#             4 = DRSI
#             5 = TFPCR/TFPCX interface.  Interrupt MUST be 0xFD or the same
#                 as stated in INIT.SRV, if any..
#             6 = Windows-driver, replaces both ESS, ESSKAM and FBBIOS.
#             7 = TCP/IP.  Needs WINSOCK.DLL.  Put port-adress as 17.
#                 TNC-emulation is T (see below) 
#             8 = TFWin.dll (only WinFBB32)
# BEWARE: The old interface 1 and 3 will NOT be used in WinFBB.  Interface 6
#         replaces both.  (FBBCOMM.DRV).  Neither ESS nor FBBIOS can be
#         used with WinFBB !

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">For LinFBB (Linux):</FONT>
# Interface   9 = Linux.  Can work via serial port (D),via AX25 domain
#                 socket (X) or via Telnet port (T).

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">For DosFBB:</FONT>
If you use drivers like COMBIOS, BPQ or DRSI-card, you must be careful to 
give the correct values here. If you use COMBIOS, FBBIOS, BPQ etc, they 
must always be loaded before you start the BBS-program.
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">In DosFBB ONLY THESE interfaces are available:</FONT>
# Interface : 1 = Use external COMBIOS-driver (MBBIOS, ESS etc)
#             2 = BPQ-node v 4.05 and up (BPQ in AA4RE-mode)
#             3 = Telephone-modem with FBBIOS
#             4 = DRSI card with driver
#             5 = TFPCR/TFPCX interface.  Interrupt MUST be 0xFD or the same
#                 as stated in INIT.SRV, if any..


<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Example for WinFBB:</FONT>

 Once more, the number of lines below must be the same as number of TNCs in
use. One line for each TNC. I think most of it is self-explanatory. MultCh
will normally be 1. If you use DRSI-card, you can use a value from 0 to 7. 
If you use BPQ, the first TNC must have MultCh 0, the next must have MultCh1
and so on.  This is very important. If you have a KAM in host-mode, you must
use 1 for VHF and 2 for HF.  When using kernel AF_AX25 socket in Linux,
MultCh is the interface name (eg: ax0). 
MxBloc decides how many kb will be forwarded one way to another BBS before 
the forward is reversed. Leave this value at 10 for VHF/UHF and a little 
smaller for HF. Type host-mode depends on your TNC, and if you use BPQ :

 # TNC     : Number on TNC in use.  Use 0 for file-forward !
 # NbCh    : Number of channels I want to use in the TNC.
 #           Maximum available channels depend on firmware.
 # Com     : Number of the COM-port. Com1, Com2 etc.
 # MultCh  : Number of channel if port-multiplexer is used, otherwise 1.
 #           In DRSI use values from 0 to 7, by KAM use 1/VHF and 2/HF.
 #           With BPQ first TNC must have MultCh 0, the next 1, etc. 
 #           When using kernel AF_AX25 socket in Linux, MultCh is the
 #           interface name (eg: ax0)
 # Paclen  : PACLEN on this TNC.
 # Maxframe: The maximum nb of frames the TNC will send at a time.
 # NbFwd   : Number of channels for OUTGOING forward at same time.
 # MxBloc  : Size of forward-block in kb.
 # M/P-Fwd : Minute of the hour for start of forward, and period
 #           (how many minutes between each forward-start).
 # Port mode, one of these:
 #           B : BBS-mode.
 #           G : "Guest"-mode.
 #           U : Normal-mode.
 # Type host-mode, one of these:
 #           D : WA8DED
 #           K : KAM hostmode.  Must use ESSKAM driver.
 #           P : PK-232
 #           Q : BPQ v 4.x
 #           T : Ethernet/TCP-IP
 #           X : AX25 domain socket (for Linux)
 # Addition: One or more of these letters can be used too:
 #           L : Send unproto beacon after each arriving mail.
 #           M : Telephone-modem.
 #           Y : Yapp allowed on this QRG.
 #           W : Gateway allowed TO this QRG.
 #           R : Modem port allowed in Read-only mode.

 At the end of the file, you can specify one (or more) callsigns and SSIDs
for some channels. You might use this for special callsigns on forward-
channels. If you don't need this (you probably don't, at least not the first
times..), place an # in front of the line. This only works with WA8DED
interface.

<B><BIG>2. Advanced setup, with more details.</BIG></B>

The BBS may use a special port-multiplexer so that you can have up to
4 TNCs per COM-port.  
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">For DosFBB</FONT> you may also use other drivers like COMBIOS, MBBIOS, FBBIOS etc.
These drivers must be loaded BEFORE the BBS-program. You can include the
drivers in APPEL.BAT for convenience. It is possible to use telephone-modem
with the BBS. In that case the number of TNCs include the modem. The FBBIOS-
driver must be loaded before the BBS starts.
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">For WinFBB</FONT> you do not need COMBIOS, MBBIOS, ESS or FBBIOS.  They are all
included in FBBCOMM.DRV (interface 6).
