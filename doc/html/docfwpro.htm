(Appendix 9)
<P>
<PRE> FBB software includes two forward protocols. The first one is standard with
MBL/RLI  protocol.  The  second  one  was  developed  to  allow 
efficiency, particularly on long links where propagation time of data are
long. The exchange of commands is reduced to a minimum, and not acknowledged
to get time. The data transfer direction is changed every block of data, a
block of data holding up to five messages. This uses the "pipeline" effect of
long links (Nodes and digipeaters), and gain some time over short links
(HF...).

 FBB protocol is very simple in its principle. It is based on MID/BID usage.
The identification is made by the F letter in the SID (system type identifier
contained in square brackets). All command lines must start in first column
with the 'F' character. All command lines are ended by a return (CR)
character.

 Suppose I call another BBS to forward some mail. When I connect another BBS
using FBB protocol, I will receive the SID followed by a text and the prompt
("&gt;"). If the SID contains the F flag, I will send immediately my SID and the
first proposal.

 Proposals looks like :

 FB P F6FBB FC1GHV FC1MVP 24657_F6FBB 1345
 F&gt; HH

 FB : Identifies the type of the command (proposal)
 P : Type of message (P = Private, B = Bulletin).
 F6FBB : Sender (from field).
 FC1GHV : BBS of recipient (@field).
 FC1MVP : Recipient (to field).
 24657_F6FBB : BID ou MID.
 1345 : Size of message in bytes.
 F&gt; : End of proposal.
 HH is optional. It is the checksum of the whole proposal in hexadecimal.

 ALL the fields are necessary. This kind of command must hold seven fields.
If a field is missing upon receiving, an error message will be send
immediately followed by a disconnection.

 A proposal can handle up to five FB command lines. If the total size of
messages seems to be too important, the proposal can handle less lines. In
FBB software, a parameter is defined in INIT.SRV file to tell the maximum
size of the message block. It is set by default to 10KB.

 Example of proposal :

 FB P F6FBB FC1GHV.FFPC.FRA.EU FC1MVP 24657_F6FBB 1345
 FB P FC1CDC F6ABJ F6AXV 24643_F6FBB 5346
 FB B F6FBB FRA FBB 22_456_F6FBB 8548
 F&gt; HH

 This proposal is limited to three FB lines, as the amount of messages
overran the 10KB limit.

 When receiving the proposal, the other BBS will reject, accept or defer the
message. This command is made by a FS line :

 FS -+=

 This means :

 - I don't want the first message (-).
 - I need the second message (+).
 - I defer the third message, as I'm still receiving it.

 In the new version 1 of FBB protocol there are 3 more responses:
 R, E or H:

 "FS +R++" means that the second message is rejected. Only works with new 
 version of the protocol.
 The information is also written in the LOG like :
 MJ B:Message_Bid V:Callsign_Rejecting
 A warning message may be sent to the sending sysop when his message is 
 rejected (see <A HREF="fmtinit.htm#Warning">INIT.SRV</A> for more info on warning messages).
 The message is not marked as 'F', and still can be forwarded to another BBS

 "FS +H++" means that the second message is held. Only works with new 
 version of the protocol.
 The information is also written in the LOG like :
 MH B:Message_Bid V:Callsign_Rejecting
 A warning message may be sent to the sending sysop when his message is 
 held (see <A HREF="fmtinit.htm#Warning">INIT.SRV</A> for more info on warning messages).

 "FS +E++" means that the second message has a format error. Only works 
 with new version of the protocol. 
 A warning message may be sent to the sending sysop when his message  
 proposal is wrong (see <A HREF="fmtinit.htm#Warning">INIT.SRV</A> for more info on warning messages).

 It should interesting to defer a message if you are still receiving it on a
other channel, or if you think that the size is to big, or for another
reason. The message should be proposed again at the next connection.

 FS line MUST have as many +,-,=, R, E, H signs as lines in the proposal.

 When receiving the FS lines, I can send the block of messages. Each message
is made with the title on the first line, the text, and a Ctrl Z in the last
line. The is no blank line between the messages.

 Title of 2nd message
 Text of 2nd message
 .....
 ^Z

 When the other BBS has received all the asked messages, it acknowledges by
sending its proposal, and the system is reversed.

 If it has no message to send, it only sends a line :

 FF

 This line must not to be followed by a F&gt;.

 If the other hand has no message, it sends a line :

 FQ

 and asks for the disconnection.


 Example :

                                &gt;

 [FBB-5.11-FHM$]     (F6FBB has the F flag in the SID)
 FB P F6FBB FC1GHV.FFPC.FRA.EU FC1MVP 24657_F6FBB 1345

                                FS +-+ (accepts the 1st and the 3rd).

                                 FB P FC1GHV F6FBB F6FBB 2734_FC1GHV 234

                                 FS + (Accepts the message)

                                 FF (still no message)

 FQ (No more message)

 Disconnection of the link.


 In this example, FBB protocol is used as the two BBS were identified by the
F flag in the SID. If F6FBB had sent the SID [FBB-5.11-MH$] when answering
FC1GHV, the protocol should be the standard MBL/RLI.

 All callsigns are only examples !
